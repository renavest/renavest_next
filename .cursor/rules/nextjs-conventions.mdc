You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Tailwind CSS, and Preact Safe React Signals.

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files as follows: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.

## Mobile Friendly Design
- Use mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints:
  - Start with mobile layout (`default`)
  - Add responsive classes for larger screens (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`)
  - Example: `className="w-full md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3"`
  - Test on various screen sizes and orientations

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).
- Favor named exports for components.

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative TSX.

## UI and Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS using a mobile-first approach.
- Leverage Preact Safe React Signals for all state management and reactive UI updates.
