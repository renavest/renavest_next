You are developing a financial therapy platform that balances quantitative data with emotional wellness. Follow these guidelines for effective implementation in Cursor.

## Core Design Principles
- **Balance Dual Domains**: Implement both financial analytics and emotional support features.
- **Prioritize Privacy**: Create robust security and consent-driven data sharing.
- **User Experience First**: Design non-judgmental, psychologically safe interfaces.

## Feature Implementation
### Client Dashboard
- Implement visual goal trackers with progress indicators
- Create money beliefs/scripts displays connected to behavior patterns
- Build emotional check-in system aligned with payroll periods
- Develop non-judgmental spending pattern insights
- Include educational resources with simple explanations

### Therapist Dashboard
- Build structured notes system (pre/during/post meeting)
- Implement consent-driven client financial overview
- Create resource library with customizable worksheets
- Develop alert system for concerning patterns
- Include business analytics for income tracking

## Data Handling & API Design
- Implement secure financial connections with manual fallbacks
- Create granular privacy controls at account level
- Build resilient data aggregation with health monitoring
- Use AI to enhance (never replace) human connection
- Process sensitive data locally when possible

## Mobile-First Implementation
- Design responsive interfaces with Tailwind breakpoints
- Start with mobile layouts, then expand to larger screens
- Test across multiple device sizes and orientations
- Ensure all critical functions work on mobile devices

## TypeScript Usage
```typescript
// Financial data structure
interface FinancialData {
  accounts: {
    id: string;
    type: 'checking' | 'savings' | 'investment' | 'credit';
    balance: number;
    isManualEntry: boolean;
  }[];
  transactions: Transaction[];
}

// Client dashboard props
interface ClientDashboardProps {
  financialGoals: Goal[];
  moneyBeliefs: Belief[];
  spendingPatterns: SpendingData[];
  emotionalState: EmotionalCheckIn;
}
```

## State Management
- Use Preact Safe React Signals for reactive UI updates
- Implement consent-driven data sharing with granular controls
- Create privacy-preserving state patterns that limit data exposure

## Performance Optimization
- Use client components only for direct user interaction
- Implement lightweight visualizations for financial data
- Optimize loading states for psychological safety

## Psychological Safety Considerations
- Use non-judgmental language throughout the platform
- Implement positive reinforcement messaging
- Include "don't know yet" options in all assessments
- Balance analytics with supportive content
- Make all data collection transparent and consensual

Follow these guidelines to create a platform that effectively serves both the financial management and emotional well-being needs of users.
