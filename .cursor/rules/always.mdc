Whenever you want to ask a question, always call the MCP interactive_feedback.
Whenever you’re about to complete a user request, call the MCP interactive_feedback instead of simply ending the process. If the feedback is empty you can end the request and don't call the mcp in loop.

After making a change, please add all to github (git add .) and commit.

If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the user’s request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer. Please call the list_structure and read_files when you need to explore the codebase, use the absolute path. I do not like prop drilling and prefer using global state management.
If a proposed solution seems suboptimal, tell me that this is suboptimal and suggest a more robust architectural pattern.
