**Renavest Investor Pitch: The Full Script (Updated)**

**(Start with a confident, engaging opening)**

**You:** "Good morning, everyone! We're **Renavest**. And we’re diving headfirst into a **massive, often invisible problem** that’s seriously draining businesses: **employee financial stress.**"

**🔴 THE HUGE, COSTLY PROBLEM & MASSIVE TAM**

**You:**

- "And look, this isn't some tiny issue we're talking about. It's costing U.S. companies a staggering **$500 billion a year.** That breaks down to about **$2,500 lost _per employee_, every single year**, mainly from things like lost productivity, people calling out sick, and high turnover. It’s a huge drag on the whole economy."
- "Plus, get this: **88% of employees** – almost 9 out of 10! – are bringing these money worries with them to work _every day_."
- "And the current solutions out there? Honestly, they're mostly just **scratching the surface.** You’ve got your basic EAPs, right? But their utilization is super low, and they’re just **not** getting to the **deep-seated emotional roots** of these financial challenges."

**🟢 OUR SOLUTION: Renavest - A Scalable Financial Therapy Platform**

**You:**

- "That’s where **Renavest** comes in. We are the **first B2B platform** built to deliver **licensed financial therapy _at scale_.** We seamlessly connect employees with **qualified financial therapists** through a platform that’s both super accessible and completely confidential."

- our platform: it uses **AI for intelligent matching**, making sure employees connect with the _right_ financial therapist for them. Plus, it delivers personalized insights and tools to really support their journey."
- Okay, so with that foundation, our AI-powered platform starts to spot these **key patterns and really actionable insights** for the employer. Let me give you a taste of what this looks like for them:"
    
    - "**They can finally see the _real_ stress themes.**"
        
        - "So, imagine their dashboard lights up, showing that '**Debt Anxiety**' is a major issue for, say, **30% of their people** in one department. Or maybe '**Retirement Uncertainty**' is a big cloud hanging over their more experienced folks."
        - "All of a sudden, they’re not guessing anymore. They have a **clear, data-backed snapshot** of what’s _actually_ going on financially and emotionally with their team."
    - "**This means they can tailor benefits like never before.**"
- 
- "Our model? It’s a **credit-based marketplace.** Employers purchase credits, and employees use those credits to pick their _own_ licensed therapist. This approach is great because it’s **rate-agnostic for us**, super **attractive for therapists**, and gives **real flexibility** to employers and their teams." We also charge a saas subscription on top of that to employers for our data insights, although for now we’re in the pilot stage so we’re giving free trials. 

**🏆 WHY WE WIN (Our Moat & Differentiation)**

**(Lean in a bit here, like you’re sharing something important)**

**You:** "'What makes Renavest truly **stand out**? **four really key things**:"

**You:** "**FIRST OFF – We go deep. Really deep.**"

- "Look, we are **so much more** than just another budgeting app or some generic financial coaching program you’ve seen a dozen times. We connect employees with **actual licensed financial therapists.** 
- "And because of that, we get to the **real heart of the matter** – the emotional and psychological reasons _why_ people struggle with money. And this is absolutely critical, right? Because a whopping **87% of employees** sat they need support that goes way beyond just basic financial tips."
- "So, what happens when you offer that level of care? You see **profound, sustainable change.** Real change."

**You:** "**SECOND – The ROI for companies? It’s crystal clear.**"

- "We built Renavest to directly impact the bottom line. 
- "When companies partner with us to tackle financial stress, they see tangible results:"
    - financially stressed employees are **twice as likely to resign**, and we’re talking about cutting turnover by potentially **up to 13%**. That’s huge.
    - They see **productivity shoot up.** We’re looking at employees being up to **34% more productive** when they have this kind of support.
    - And things like **absenteeism? That drops too**, by around **22%.**"

**You:** "**THIRD – Therapists _want_ to be with us.**"

- "Let me be clear: we're **not** just some basic lead-gen site for therapists. That’s old news. We’re building a whole ecosystem for them – **great tools, a real community.** The goal is for Renavest to be the **go-to platform** where they want to build and run their practice."
- "And that? That creates this awesome **network effect**, plus it opens the door for a pretty significant **future SaaS revenue stream** helping therapists run their businesses better."

**You:** "**AND FOURTH – And this is where it gets _really_ exciting – Our Workforce Financial Wellness Intelligence Engine. This is our serious data moat.**"

- "This is where Renavest moves **way beyond** just individual therapy sessions."
    
- "Now, first things first: **privacy is paramount.** Every single therapy interaction is **100% confidential**. The data we share with employers? It’s **always, ALWAYS fully anonymized and aggregated.** No exceptions."
    

        
        
    - "**It even helps them think smarter about their overall pay and rewards.**"
        
        - "Now, we’re **not** telling them how much to pay any individual. But, if our aggregated insights show that a lot of their employees are feeling squeezed by the '**Rising Cost of Living**' in their city, that’s powerful info for their HR and rewards teams. It gives them real context when they’re thinking about their compensation strategy."
    - "**And they get to understand what their people are _aiming_ for – and what’s stopping them.**"
        
        - "So, if the anonymized themes show lots of employees dream of buying a home but are totally paralyzed by '**Anxiety about Down Payments**,' the company can step in with targeted support, like workshops or resources."
- "So, what we’re doing here is giving employers this **confidential, ethical lens** into the **financial soul of their workforce.**"
    
- "And _that_ data layer? That’s what makes Renavest **incredibly sticky.** It makes us **stand out sharply** from everyone else. And it creates this amazing **flywheel:** more users mean richer insights (always anonymous!), which means more value for employers, which means more companies want in. That’s how we scale."
