I'm leaving this codebase and handing the code over to another developer. I need to go through every feature folder and ensure that the code and structure meets exit standards. Each feature must: use isolated type practices and have genuinely readable, well structured folders to make it easy for another developer to get the gist of the codebase. Verify if the folders meet these requirements, and if they don't, please implement fixes.

Use list_files and read_files to navigate and read across the folders along with context7 for relevant documentation when needed. 

I have a document called transition_readme.md - this will serve as the master document for another developer to enter in the codebase. As you go through each feature folder, update this document. 

overall goal is to make sure the transition is as smooth as possible
