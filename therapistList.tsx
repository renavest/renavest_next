    long_bio:
      "Using financial therapy tools we explore how and why one relates to money the way they do. We look at how beliefs, values, and money histories shape financial decisions and work toward aligning one's resources with the life they are creating. We also work on communication skills when it comes to expressing financial concerns and needs. The work often includes creating a financial snapshot, establishing new spending patterns, and learning techniques to improve goal setting and achievement. I can provide investment education and advice as well. My base session rate is $120 an hour. I also provide packages of services. My most common package includes three personalized one-on-one sessions with financial planning/analysis (financial snapshot, cash flow review, debt analysis, goal setting, etc), and that is typically $540. I can create custom packages and can offer a sliding scale when necessary. I also offer payment plans, typically dividing the cost over the number of sessions. I can offer investment management (though I only do that in select cases where it makes sense for the client), that fee is an asset under management fee typically of 1.5%",
